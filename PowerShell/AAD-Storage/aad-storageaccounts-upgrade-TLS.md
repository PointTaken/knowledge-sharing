# Script content

This script appears to be a PowerShell script that upgrades the TLS (Transport Layer Security) version for Azure storage accounts.

The script prompts the user to confirm whether they want to proceed with the upgrade. If the user enters "Y" to continue, the script iterates over a collection of storage accounts and uses the Set-AzStorageAccount cmdlet to set the minimum TLS version to TLS 1.2 for each storage account.

If the user does not enter "Y" to continue, the script simply continues execution without performing any upgrades.

Overall, this script provides a way to automate the process of upgrading the TLS version for multiple Azure storage accounts.This script appears to be a PowerShell script that upgrades the TLS (Transport Layer Security) version for Azure storage accounts.
